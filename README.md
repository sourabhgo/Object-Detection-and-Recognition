# Object-Detection-and-Recognition

Both Object detection and recognition are
extensively used in robotic applications. Used a popular ROS package
for 2D object detection. The package is called find_2d_object, and we covered object
detection using a webcam and Kinect. After creating a demo using this package, we
did 3D object recognition using a ROS package called object_recognition, which
is mainly for 3D object recognition. We built and captured the object model
and its training procedure. After training,we started detecting the
object using a depth camera. Finally, we visualized the object recognition in Rviz.
